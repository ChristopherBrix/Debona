The format of .nnet in Neurify is customized from Reluplex and ReluVal.

Here is a detailed description for nnet format:
===================
line1: // comment for this network
line2: layer number (include output layer but exclude input layer), input dimension, output dimension, maximal number of nodes for each layer
line3: Whether each layer is convolutional (e.g., 1,1,0,0 means totally 4 layers and the previous two are convolutional layers while the last two are fully connected)
line4 and later: each line describes the information for convolutional layers as $out_channel, in_channel, kernel, stride, padding$
===================


Tips for transferring the models:
transfer.py is a sample code for transferring the tensorflow/keras models to nnet format.
Due to the version conflicts or model definitions in different ML frameworks, chances are high that one needs to slightly change the code to successfully transfer the models. 
Note that one must check closely whether the returned outputs of transferred nnet model in Neurify are the same as the outputs of your own network under tensorflow/keras.
